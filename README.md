110632 - one timerange is off, maybe higher order baseline can fix
110637 - look more reasonable

Noise is about 250-300mK in 15 mins. They said they needed ~8 hours to see something,
which suggests 40-50 mK.

Tsys in one pol is 140K, the other 180K, a lot higher.  Same for the other obs,  160k vs. 190k.

new data jan 2025 (125295, 125297, 125301, 125303, ...)


Some data have bad time-ranges, that needs to be removed using sample=   !!!    or rmscut=
